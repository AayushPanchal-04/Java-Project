A rule-based Java application that analyzes news headlines to detect potential fake news using pattern matching, regex, and string analytics—no machine learning required!



## 🎯 About

This project demonstrates how to build an intelligent headline analyzer without using machine learning. It uses rule-based detection to identify suspicious patterns commonly found in fake news and clickbait headlines. Perfect for learning text processing, regex, and Java fundamentals!

**Why Rule-Based?**
- Fast and efficient
- No training data required
- Transparent decision-making
- Easy to understand and modify
- Great for educational purposes

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Sensational Word Detection** - Identifies emotionally charged words
- 📢 **ALL CAPS Analysis** - Flags excessive capitalization
- ❗ **Punctuation Pattern Matching** - Detects overuse of exclamation/question marks
- 🎣 **Clickbait Phrase Recognition** - Identifies common clickbait patterns
- 📊 **Scoring System** - Assigns suspicion scores from 0-100
- ⚡ **Real-time Analysis** - Interactive command-line interface
- 🏷️ **Classification Categories** - 4-tier classification system

================================================================================
```

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: Java 8+
- **Core APIs**: 
  - `java.util.regex` - Pattern matching
  - `java.util.stream` - Functional operations
  - `java.util.Scanner` - User input

## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or text editor

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd fake-news-detector
```

3. Compile the Java file
```bash
javac FakeNewsDetector.java
```

4. Run the application
```bash
java FakeNewsDetector
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the application
2. Enter a news headline when prompted
3. View the analysis results including:
   - Suspicion score (0-100)
   - Classification level
   - Specific flags detected
4. Continue analyzing more headlines
5. Type `exit` to quit

### Example Headlines to Try

**Legitimate:**
- "Scientists discover new planet in solar system"
- "Government announces new policy changes"
- "Local team wins championship game"

**Suspicious:**
- "SHOCKING: This MIRACLE cure will CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!"
- "You Won't Believe What This Celebrity Did Next!!"
- "DOCTORS HATE HIM! One simple trick to lose weight!!!"

## 🔧 How It Works

### Detection Rules

1. **Sensational Words** (20 points each)
   - Words like: shocking, unbelievable, miracle, exposed, conspiracy
   
2. **ALL CAPS** (15-25 points)
   - Single ALL CAPS word: 15 points
   - Multiple ALL CAPS words: 25 points

3. **Excessive Punctuation** (20 points)
   - Patterns like `!!!`, `???`, `!?!?`

4. **Clickbait Phrases** (30 points)
   - "you won't believe"
   - "what happens next"
   - "doctors hate"
   - "one simple trick"

5. **Excessive Exclamations** (15 points)
   - 3 or more exclamation marks

### Classification Thresholds

| Score Range | Classification |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0-29 | LEGITIMATE |
| 30-49 | SOMEWHAT SUSPICIOUS |
| 50-69 | SUSPICIOUS |
| 70-100 | HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS |

## 🎨 Customization

### Add More Sensational Words

```java
private static final Set<String> SENSATIONAL_WORDS = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(
    "shocking", "unbelievable", "amazing", "incredible", "miracle",
    "yourword1", "yourword2"  // Add your words here
));
```

### Adjust Scoring Weights

Modify the point values in the `analyzeHeadline()` method:

```java
if (sensationalCount > 0) {
    score += (int)(sensationalCount * 20);  // Change this value
}
```

### Add New Detection Rules

Create new regex patterns:

```java
private static final Pattern YOUR_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("your_regex");
```
